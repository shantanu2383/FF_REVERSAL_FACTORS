# FF_REVERSAL_FACTORS
This repository contains code to reconstruct the Fama French Momentum, Short-Term Reversal, and Long-Term Reversal Factors from scratch. The reconstruction utilizes real-time price data and Zacks Fundamentals Data.

The reconstructed factors achieve a correlation of approximately 98% with the original factors, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of our approach. This makes our reconstruction a useful tool for those who need real-time, up-to-date factor data.
